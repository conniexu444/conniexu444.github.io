        <p id="aboutmeparagraph">
            My name is Constance "Connie" Xu. This is my minimalist website. I am a student at Stevens Institute of Technology (Go Ducks!) 
            and I am a computer science major. In my spare time, I like to paint--albeit, I am not very good at it--and read. I also bullet journal extensively.
            I recently picked up pennyboarding. One fun fact about me is that I read the New York Times every single day. I have an older brother and a 
            younger sister that is ten years younger than me. My younger sibling likes to copy everything I do so I know that i have to set a good example and be
            a good role model. I truly hope she decides to step into the world of STEM (although, my brother might be dragging her into politics. It is totally
            up to her of course, it is her perogative. I am here to offer guidance if she wants some).

            My personal belief is that every woman that is studying for a computer science degree has at least one woman role model. For me, it was this 
            computer science professor at Swarthmore. She doesn't know this but she is really someone who has continually inspired me to stay and pursue
            a career in computer science.
